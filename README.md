# Nixtee Connectors for Python

Nixtee Connectors for Python is a library that provides seamless integration with Nixtee's services and APIs. This package allows Python developers to interact easily with various Nixtee services within their applications.

---

## Getting Started

To use Nixtee Connectors in your Python project, you need to install it using **pip**.

### Installation

You can install the package from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install nixtee-connectors-python
```

Alternatively, you can install the library directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ajandera/nixtee-connectors-python.git
```

## Setup

Once you’ve installed the package, you can start using the connectors by providing your API key and other configuration settings.

### Usage Example

Here’s a basic example of how to use the connector:

```python
from nixtee_connectors import NixteeConnector

# Initialize the connector with your API key
connector = NixteeConnector(api_key="your-api-key")

# Make a request to the Nixtee service
try:
    result = connector.connect()
    print("Connection successful:", result)
except Exception as e:
    print("Error connecting:", str(e))
```

In the above example, replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual Nixtee API key.

## Available Connectors

The library provides several connectors for different Nixtee services:

- **Nixtee Connector 1**: A connector for interacting with Service 1 of Nixtee.
- **Nixtee Connector 2**: A connector for interacting with Service 2 of Nixtee.

Each connector provides methods that allow you to interact with the corresponding Nixtee service.
